A behavior tree is graphically represented as a directed tree  in which the nodes are classified as root, control flow nodes, or execution nodes (tasks).
A control flow node is used to control the subtasks of which it is composed.

 - Selector (fallback) node: Fallback nodes are used to find and execute the first child that does not fail.
 -  Sequence node: Sequence nodes are used to find and execute the first child that has not yet succeeded.
